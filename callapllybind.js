///currying
// Currying refers to the process of transforming a function with multiple arity into the same function with less arity. The curried effect is achieved by binding some of the arguments to the first function invoke, so that those values are fixed for the next invocation.
//  two ways to achieve that, firstly by using bind function and the second using the concept of closure.

//multiplyByThree(5);
//currying using closures
